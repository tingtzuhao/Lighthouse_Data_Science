 The Chinook Database is about an imaginary video and music store. Each track is stored using one of the digital formats and has a genre. The store has also some playlists, where a single track can be part of several playlists. Orders are recorded for customers, but are called invoices. Every customer is assigned a support employee, and Employees report to other employees.
